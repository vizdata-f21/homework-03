# homework-03

---

**NOTE:** Homework 3 is not yet completely written, but if you're looking 
to get started today, I've included one of the exercises below. This document 
will be updated by the end of the day on Mon, Oct 4, with the complete 
assignment. For now, you can start working on the one exercise if you like. 
Your individual repos are also not yet created so save your code somewhere 
for now. Repos will be created at the time the homework is fully published.

For any exercise where you’re writing code, insert a code chunk and make
sure to label the chunk. Use a short and informative label. For any
exercise where you’re creating a plot, make sure to label all axes,
legends, etc. and give it an informative title. For any exercise where
you’re including a description and/or interpretation, use full
sentences. Make a commit at least after finishing each exercise, or
better yet, more frequently. Push your work regularly to GitHub. Once
you’re done, inspect your GitHub repo to make sure it has all the
components you want to submit in the `homework-03.md` file, including the
prose, the code, and all plots.

1.  **Thank you.** Make a plot that says "Thank you" on it. Get creative! 
    You can make it however you like, e.g., annotation, geoms, fake data, etc. 
    There will be points assigned to creativity for this exercise. So just 
    annotating the plot with the letters would earn fewer poits than a more 
    creative approach. Also, use as little as defaults as possible, 
    in terms of color scales, themes, etc. The plots you make will be shared with 
    our guest speakers as part of a "thank you" note. If you would like your 
    name shown on the plots shared with them, you should add your name somewhere 
    on the plot, e.g., the caption. If you don't want your name shown, just leave it 
    out and the plot will be shared anonymously. (There are no points attached to 
    this, you can choose to share with your name or anonymously.)

2.  **Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the ugliest of them all?** Make a plot of 
    the variables in the `penguins` dataset from the **palmerpenguins** package. 
    Your plot should use at least two variables, but more is fine too. 
    First, make the plot using the default theme and color scales. 
    Then, update the plot to be as ugly as possible. You will probably want to play
    around with theme options, colors, fonts, etc. The ultimate goal is the 
    ugliest possible plot, and the sky is the limit!
